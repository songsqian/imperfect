## Computational details of the "Imperfect" paper

This repository includes (1) R and Stan code (`BayesRule.Rmd`) used in the manuscript on the interpretation of results from imperfect tests (the RMarkdown file documents additional details of Bayesian computation), and (2) a PDF file of an early version of Figure 1 (`van.pdf`).
